hi
im starting to learn to make my own mods and hopefully later my own games and programs
im new to all this but no stranger to learning things just for the fun of it

as of making this i have 4 years experience in blender 3d modelling and 3d animation, and i've taken classes on graphic design and programming in HTML and JavaScript
i may not be the best at anything i do, but we are all learning anyway.
